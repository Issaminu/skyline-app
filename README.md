# About

As part of creating a solution that solves the multitude of problems encountered by 
co-owners, I conceived and created a web application that centralizes all 
the actions relating to managing buildings.

A complete and innovative solution of co-ownership management which takes into 
account all the functionalities essential to the activity of a syndic would be 
extremely beneficial to any co-owner. It would allow easy access to information on 
who, when and how much someone has contributed to the building's treasury, as 
well as provide clear and detailed information on how the contributed funds are 
spent. This ensures total transparency of the collection and spending of funds.

My solution, hosted on the web at www.skyline-app.ga on a Heroku server, 
allows users to add buildings where they own or rent apartments to the application, 
invite other co-owners to join the building, give some of them administrator 
privileges over the building, as well as manage the collection of co-owner funds and 
spend these funds on various actions related to the improvement of their common 
space, such as building improvements, repairs, etc.
